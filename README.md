# HOUNDDOG

Used for sniffing packets from Software Defined Radios and parsing the outputted the Vita 49 A packets.

You can:

Change the save location of the parsed data.
Choose different interfaces of your computer to use as a capture point.
Turn on or off full Verbosity in the report.
Cap how many packets are captured.
Look at the live packet count graph to monitor performance.
Look at the Spectral Display showing the data payloads from the packets.
Change the refresh rate of the Spectral Display.


TODO:
Look into Linux Compatibility.
Work on IQ graph of Complex data payloads. (Current spectral display only works for Real data payloads)
More Verbosity levels to choose from.
Possibly more live data graphs?
Add more fields to be parsed from data and context packets.
Get more documentation for V49a format.
